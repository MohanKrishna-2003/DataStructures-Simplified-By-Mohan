LINEAR SEARCH : 

Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list or array until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.
It starts at the beginning and compares each element one by one until the desired element is found or the entire list has been traversed.


TIME COMPLEXITY : O(n)

BEST CASE : O(1)
WORST CASE : O(n)
SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)
AVERAGE COMPARISIONS : (n+1)/2
