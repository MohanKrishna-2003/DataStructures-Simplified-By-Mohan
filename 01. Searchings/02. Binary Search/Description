BINARY SEARCH : 

Binary search is a search algorithm used to efficiently locate a specific target value within a sorted collection (e.g., an array or list) by repeatedly dividing the search range in half until the target is found or the search range becomes empty.
This approach significantly reduces the number of comparisons required compared to linear search, making it faster for large datasets.

TIME COMPLEXITY : O(logn)

WORST CASE and AVERAGE CASE -> O(logn)
BEST CASE -> O(1)
