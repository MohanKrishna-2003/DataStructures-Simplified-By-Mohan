QUICK SORT :

Quick sort is a popular sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays and recursively sorting them. It selects a pivot element and places it in its correct position, with smaller elements on the left and larger elements on the right. 
This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

TIME COMPLEXITY:- O(nlogn)

BEST CASE : O(nlogn)
WORST CASE : O(n^2)
SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)
AUXILLARY TIME COMPLEXITY : O(logn) {due to the function call stack..simply recursion}
