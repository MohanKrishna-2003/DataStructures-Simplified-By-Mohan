INSERTION SORT :

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects an element from an unsorted list and inserts it into its correct position within a sorted portion of the list, effectively building a sorted list from the unsorted one.

TIME COMPLEXITY:- O(n^2)

BEST CASE = O(n) {if array is already sorted}
WORST CASE = O(n^2) {if array is in reverse order}
AUXILLARY SPACE COMPLEXITY = O(1)
