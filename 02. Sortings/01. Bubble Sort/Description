BUBBLE SORT {BAD ALGORITHM NOOB}:

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements, compares adjacent pairs, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted, with the largest elements "bubbling" to the end of the list in each pass.

TIME COMPLEXITY:- O(n^2)

BEST CASE = O(n) {if the elements are already sorted}
WORST CASE = O(n^2)
AVERAGE CASE = O(n^2) 
THE AVERAGE COMPARISIONS = n(n-1)/2
