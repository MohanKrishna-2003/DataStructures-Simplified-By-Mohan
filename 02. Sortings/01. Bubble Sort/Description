BUBBLE SORT {BAD ALGORITHM NOOB}:

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
This process continues until the entire list is sorted.


TIME COMPLEXITY:- O(n^2)

BEST CASE = O(n) {if the elements are already sorted}
WORST CASE = O(n^2)
AVERAGE CASE = O(n^2) 
THE AVERAGE COMPARISIONS = n(n-1)/2
