MERGE SORT:

Mergesort is a popular computer algorithm for sorting a list or array of elements. 
It works by dividing the unsorted list into smaller sublists, sorting those sublists, and then merging them back together to produce a sorted list. 
This process of dividing, sorting, and merging continues until the entire list is sorted. 
Mergesort is known for its stability and consistent performance, making it a reliable choice for sorting tasks.
