STACK : 

A stack is a simple data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine it like a stack of plates where you can only add or remove plates from the top. Here's a simple explanation:

Stack: 

A stack is a collection of elements (items) with two main operations:

1. Push: This operation adds an item to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: This operation removes and returns the item from the top of the stack.

There's also a third operation:

3. Peek (or Top): This operation allows you to look at the item on the top of the stack without removing it.

Think of a stack like a pile of books. You can add a new book on top (push), take the top book off (pop), or just look at the title of the top book without removing it (peek).

A real-world example of a stack is the call stack in computer programming, where functions are pushed onto the stack when they are called and popped off when they return.

Stacks are used in many algorithms and applications, including managing function calls in computer programs, parsing expressions, and solving problems like the Tower of Hanoi.
